## 03a_modality_integration

This folder refers to Section `2.5.1 Predicting missing modalities`. Script `030_bash_run.sh` contains executions of all code for this section.

### Testing

Here we predict both modalities based on paired, and single-modality data (rna and atac, separately). The results are visually shown in Figure 3B of the manuscript and predictions are evaluated in the Supplementaries (see analysis).

### Analysis

Because this section is very short, the analysis is included in the script `030_bash_run.sh`. The data frames generated in the last script (`predictions_summary.py`) give the results of Supplementary Tables 4 and 5.

## !Note!

***This is still a work in progress, and we hope you have patience with us. We are cleaning and refactoring our code from more than half a year of work for you, so that you can run the experiments from our manuscript.***
