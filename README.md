# The code used to produce results for multiDGD

This is a separate repository from our tool [multiDGD](https://github.com/Center-for-Health-Data-Science/multiDGD), collecting all our code we used to produce the results presented in our manuscript. Experiments are ordered according to their appearance in the manuscript and contain code for training and analysing the model and for making the figures.
