# multiDGD paper experiments

This is a separate repository from our tool [multiDGD](https://github.com/Center-for-Health-Data-Science/multiDGD), collecting our code we used to produce the results presented in our manuscript. Experiments are ordered according to their appearance in the manuscript and contain code for training and analysing the model and for making the figures.

Since this was a large project, it is not possible to provide only a single bash script to execute a complete reproduction. In every experiment, however, you can find instructions on how to execute each step.

This repository is still a work in progress, as we are cleaning up the project to provide you with a well-structured pipeline.

If you would like to use multiDGD or scDGD, we recommend the package repositories [multiDGD](https://github.com/Center-for-Health-Data-Science/multiDGD) and [scDGD](https://github.com/Center-for-Health-Data-Science/scDGD).
